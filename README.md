# PlusYou <br>

This is a client side application that is built with react that provides an interface where<br>
one can login to create events for other people to join.<br>


## Getting Started <br>
First clone this repository down and run ```yarn install``` in the project's folder to download <br>
all the packages included with the project<br>
Then, it is a good idea to run ```yarn cy:open``` in the terminal to check if cypress is installed<br> 
and functioning how it should.<br>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.<br>
This client was built to pair up with the api at the url of https://github.com/CraftAcademy/bundle_api<br>


## Running the tests

```yarn cy:open``` in terminal

### Break down into end to end tests

The tests that have been written test the basic interface of the website.
There are tests for creating an event, joining an event, and one for making sure that the lists of events appear on the home view.
These tests are important when in the development environment, because they automate many things that would be tedious to have to run a server and manually check for.
