# PlusYou <br>

This is a client side application that is built with react that provides an interface where<br>
one can login to create events for other people to join.<br>


## Getting Started <br>
First clone this repository down and run ```yarn install``` in the project's folder to download <br>
all the packages included with the project<br>
Then, it is a good idea to run ```yarn cy:open``` in the terminal to check if cypress is installed<br> 
and functioning how it should.<br>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.<br>
This client was built to pair up with the api at the url of https://github.com/CraftAcademy/bundle_api<br>
